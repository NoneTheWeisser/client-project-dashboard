# Department Reporting Dashboard

Duration: ~3–4 week sprint

## Repository Context

This repository represents **my personal copy and deployment** of the Department Reporting Dashboard, created for portfolio and demonstration purposes.

The application was originally developed as part of a **group client engagement** during a 3–4 week sprint. This version is maintained independently from the client’s official repository and is intended to showcase my contributions, architecture decisions, and deployment approach.

Client credentials and sensitive configuration values are not included.

## Overview

The Department Reporting Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to consolidate and visualize key metrics across multiple organizational departments, including:

Community Outreach, Development, Finance, Housing, Media, Pantry, Kitchen, HR, Compliance, and Shelter.

This repository reflects the final application architecture and implementation used for deployment and long-term maintenance.

Client credentials, service logins, and sensitive configuration values are intentionally **not included** in this repository and are provided separately in the client handoff document.

## Project Description

The dashboard enables staff and administrators to quickly view KPIs, charts, tables, and upcoming events for each department. It supports both high-level summaries and detailed monthly reporting, allowing data to be filtered by year, building, volunteer, donor, and other relevant attributes.

The application was built with long-term maintainability in mind, using reusable components, centralized state management, and a modular folder structure.

### Problems Solved

- Centralizes reporting for multiple departments into a single application
- Replaces manual or spreadsheet-based reporting workflows
- Visualizes data through KPIs, charts, and tables
- Enables filtering and exploration of historical data
- Provides a scalable structure for adding new departments or metrics

### Solution Summary

- React-based frontend with reusable KPI cards, charts, and tables
- Zustand for global state management
- Express.js backend API
- PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Modular architecture to support future expansion

## Deployed Application

This repository is deployed as a **personal instance** of the application and is publicly accessible at:

## Prerequisites

The following tools must be installed before running the project locally:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Optional: [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or another Postgres client

## Environment Variables

This project requires environment variables to function correctly.

Create a `.env` file in the project root using the following format:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

A .env.sample file should be included in the repo with placeholder values.
Do not commit real credentials.

## Local Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```
 npm install
```

3. Create a PostgreSQL database:

```
 CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

4. Run the SQL scripts in tables.sql to create tables and seed initial data
5. Create a .env file as described above
6. Start the application:

```
npm run server
npm run client
```

7. The client will open automatically in a new browser tab

## Usage

- Navigate to the dashboard homepage to view department summary cards
- Select a department to view detailed KPIs, charts, and tables
- KPI cards display high-level metrics (e.g., volunteers, donations, housing occupancy)
- Charts show monthly or yearly trends
- Tables allow filtering by relevant fields such as year, building, volunteer, or donor

## Deployment

The application is currently deployed using [hosting provider name].

To deploy a new instance:

- Configure environment variables in the hosting platform
- Set up a managed PostgreSQL database
- Build and deploy the server and client applications
  Hosting and scaling costs vary depending on traffic and data volume. Current pricing and recommendations are outlined in the client handoff document.

## Known Issues

Any known bugs or limitations should be tracked as GitHub Issues in this repository. These issues are non-blocking unless otherwise noted.
